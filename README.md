In this project, we analyzed the contents of geotagged Twitter data files throughout 22020. Using shell scripts and python files, we reduced the data into separate files sorted by language and country. 

The visualize file generated four plots between two hashtags '#coronavirus' and '#코로나바이러스' depending on language and country for a total of four plots.

'#coronavirus', sorted by country
<img src='coronavirus (country).png' width=100% />
'#coronavirus', sorted by language
<img src='coronavirus (lang).png' width=100% />
'#코로나바이러스', sorted by country
<img src='코로나바이러스 (country).png' width=100% />
'#코로나바이러스', sorted by language
<img src='코로나바이러스 (lang).png' width=100% />

Additionally, we wrote an alternative reduce file to create line plots of the number of tweets under input hashtag "keys" by days in the year.
